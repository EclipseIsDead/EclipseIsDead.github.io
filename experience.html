				<span id="soft-green">Changing Baffin Bay Fish Distribution and Their Effects on Inuit Communities...</span> <br>
				The purpose of this study was to <span id="soft-purple">
				examine data on fish population shifts and ocean warming in the Davis 
				Strait and Baffin Bay region, and consider how these shifts may affect Inuit communities</span>. 
				We examined data from 1950 to 2010 on fish sightings as well as trends in warming and decreasing 
				salinity due to melting glaciers in that region. Specifically, we conducted <span id="blue">generational analysis 
				of various fish species alongside heat maps of fish spottings</span> which were used to determine population 
				migration trends for certain species. We found a <span id="soft-red">recent shift in migration patterns</span> for several 
				species of fish which <span id="red">may be correlated with the previously established ocean warming</span>. 
				This shift was observed in the species Macrouidae, Myctophidae, Phycidae, Zoarcidae, and Salmonidae. 
				The migration of the Salmonidae is <span id="yellow">especially consequential</span> due to the dependence of Inuit peoples on 
				salmonidae for sustenance during certain parts of the year. Assuming that this link is <span id="purple">causal</span>, and that 
				feedback mechanisms for glacial melting will only <span id="orange">accelerate warming</span> , we anticipate that this effect has 
				the potential to upset traditional ways of life for Inuit communities in the region.

				At the High School Big Data Challenge, this paper won the <span id="green">$1000 dollar RBC Arnold Chan Memorial Prize</span>.
