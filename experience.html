				The purpose of this study was to examine data on fish population shifts and ocean warming in the Davis 
				Strait and Baffin Bay region, and consider how these shifts may affect Inuit communities. 
				We examined data from 1950 to 2010 on fish sightings as well as trends in warming and decreasing 
				salinity due to melting glaciers in that region. Specifically, we conducted generational analysis 
				of various fish species alongside heat maps of fish spottings which were used to determine population 
				migration trends for certain species. We found a recent shift in migration pattern's for several 
				species of fish which may be correlated with the previously established ocean warming. 
				This shift was observed in the species Macrouidae, Myctophidae, Phycidae, Zoarcidae, and Salmonidae. 
				The migration of the Salmonidae is especially consequential due to the dependence of Inuit peoples on 
				salmonidae for sustenance during certain parts of the year. Assuming that this link is causal, and that 
				feedback mechanisms for glacial melting will only accelerate warming, we anticipate that this effect has 
				the potential to upset traditional ways of life for Inuit communities in the region.
