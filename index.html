			I have completed my personal website overhaul, starting from scratch and working to design something nice.
			This website is an Apple II Terminal styled personal website, using the
			<a href="https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox" target="_blank" id="soft-purple">gruvbox</a> 
			aesthetic. I'm looking forward to 2021
			<span id="soft-red">(</span>
			hopefully better than 2020...

			The augmented reality project, initially undertaken at my school to 
			foster more innovation in a high school setting, was cut short by coronavirus. Having graduated it seems 
			unlikely that I will be returning to continue development. Although I was unable to see the project come to 
			fruition, the knowledge of augmented reality and Unity 3D on the LeapMotion platform will surely come in useful. 
			And who knows, I may come back to it at a later date to develop and pick up where I left out.
