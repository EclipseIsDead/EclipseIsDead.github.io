        <hr />
        <div>
            I'm a 4th year Computer Science Specialist + Math Major @ the
            University of Toronto. Reach me by filling in the blank @
            <b>sidmcheath_gmail.com</b>. I build stuff in C/Assembly, CUDA,
            Python, TS and Rust. Currently learning how to use WebAssembly. The
            "stuff" in question is a mix of NLP, Computer Vision, and math. In
            that same vein, I'm interested in compression, kernel programming,
            and... math. In my spare time, I contribute to open source projects
            and write retro games in MIPS Assembly.
