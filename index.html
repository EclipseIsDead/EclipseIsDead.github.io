                    I'm a 4th year Computer Science Specialist + Math Major @
                    the University of Toronto. Reach me by filling in the blank
                    @
                    <b>sidmcheath_gmail.com</b>. I build stuff in C/C++,
                    Assembly, CUDA, Python, TS and Rust. Currently learning Zig
                    and how to use WebAssembly. The "stuff" in question is a mix
                    of NLP, Computer Vision, and math. In that same vein, I'm
                    interested in compression, kernel programming, and... math.
                    In my spare time, I contribute to open source projects, bug
                    hunt and write retro games in MIPS Assembly.

                    To be clear the username is from the first IDE I ever used,
                    Eclipse. 20 minutes into my first programming class in
                    highschool (java) and I hated it. Hence, the username
                    (although I guess it's more of a prediction than anything
                    else at this point). I've only ever met one person who
                    actually used Eclipse as an IDE in the workforce, and it
                    felt like it was out of spite to be honest.
