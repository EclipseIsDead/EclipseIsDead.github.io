        <h1>D&D 5e Dungeon Planner</h1>
        <h2>February 6, 2025</h2>

            After a bit of a coding hiatus, a few friends and I decided to write
            an open source dungeon planner with C++ to move our campaign online.
            All the popular options we looked at were either subscription based
            or just not very good. The base repo was copied from my terrible
            little fluid simulator because I love the shader class and makefile
            setup.

        <div>
            The core setup is similar to Dwarf Fortress, with a top-down z-slice
            of the map being rendered at any given moment. This tool is meant to
            be used by the DM and screen-shared to players with built in
            initiative tracking and simple saving/loading of maps. The UI will
            be presented with a seperate dialog window that updates class
            instances/global variables before the game loop renders the updates.
