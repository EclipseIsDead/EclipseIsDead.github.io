            After spending 4 years of univeristy working heavily with React,
            Express, Electron, Tailwind, Vue, etc., I've slowly come to realize
            I hate it. That isn't to say I'm just going to forget my JS
            framework experience or stop writing web apps, but my perspective of
            what a nice website is has definitely shifted.
        </div>

        <div>
            This site used to have a gruvbox terminal aesthetic, with dynamic
            ASCII borders and the works, but it also looked weird on different
            browsers and different resolutions. After browsing react and flask
            templates, looking at vercel docs, and exploring MUI articles I
            realized that this was all a huge pain. A website should:
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>Load fast. The DOM should be fully rendered ASAP.</li>
            <li>
                Look the same on different devices. You can leave out mobile if
                you're lazy but everything else is a must.
            </li>
            <li>Convey the information it's meant to, quickly and clearly.</li>
        </ul>
        <div>
            While it's my personal hope that this website does so, I know that
            this may take a very long time to achieve. Doesn't mean I'll stop
            trying.
