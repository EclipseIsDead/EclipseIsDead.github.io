            Working in assembly, especially with other people is pretty fun but
            a lot harder than you expect. Without a strict convention on how to
            work with registers, it's very easy to ruin a project. Here are some
            quick takeaways:
        </div>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Use a decent IDE</b> - It's hard to run assembly programs,
                especially if they use a bitmap display, without explaining the
                setup. My go-to is MARS IDE, but you can use whatever you want.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Comment every line</b> - I mean legit every line, unless it's
                so self explanatory that a child could figure it out. Here's an
                example:
                <pre>
                    <code>
                        move $a0, $t0 # need to check this value for user!
                        li $v0,1 # syscall for print_int
                        syscall
                    </code>
                </pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Use a debugger</b> - I've watched people stare at their code
                like it's gonna magically start working, dropping an hour on
                using their brain as an interpreter before finally using a
                debugger. It's assembly. Save yourself the time. Go line by
                line. You don't have a choice.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Keep it simple</b> - A lot of times, you don't even need
                abstractions. For example, when I was coding Frogger, I spent a
                day on implementing a linked list and my own malloc, until I
                realized a single static queue was good enough. Trees and linked
                lists were invented by your algo course to keep you down.
            </li>
        </ul>
