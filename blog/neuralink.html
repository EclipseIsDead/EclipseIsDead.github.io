        <h1>The Neuralink Compression Challenge</h1>

        <div>
            I saw
            <a href="https://x.com/lookoutitsbbear/status/1794959209156722767"
                >this</a
            >
            twitter/X thread on the challenge and thought it was hilarious so I
            gigured I'd give it a stab. After the initial analysis, I realized
            this was quite the fucked up dataset and figured after shaving the
            last few bits off the dataset and removing the steps in the signal,
            I could plug it into a PCA representation before hitting it with
            BZ2. The actual implementation will have to wait though, but because
            the signal itself is straightforward without all the noise this
            should be a decent >10x compression format.

        <div>Will definitely revisit this later though.</div>
